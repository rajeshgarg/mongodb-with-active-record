gem 'bson_ext'
gem 'mongo_mapper'
Install the gems

bundle install
Generate a config file for mongo_mapper (config/mongo.yml)

rails g mongo_mapper:config
Change the values as required in the YML file

defaults: &defaults
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 27017

development:
  <<: *defaults
  database: demos_development
Now, let’s create the model which will be stored in MongoDB

class MongoPost
  include MongoMapper::Document

  key :title, String
  key :content, String

  timestamps!

  validates_presence_of :title, :content
end
To create the controller and views that interact with this model, let’s simply generate the scaffolding using

rails g scaffold mongo_post title:string content:string
This generates an ActiveRecord migration too, which we need to delete! It will also prompt you to keep or overwrite the existing model file (app/models/mongo_post.rb). Obviously, we need to keep the existing file.

You can now run the app and visit http://localhost:3000/mongo_posts to create and edit posts that get stored in MongoDB. After saving a post, check to see that it exists in MongoDB:

ashwinp@app2:~/projects/demos$ mongo
MongoDB shell version: 1.4.4
url: test
connecting to: test
type "help" for help
> use demos_development
switched to db demos_development
> show collections
mongo_posts
system.indexes
> db.mongo_posts.find()

{ "_id" : ObjectId("51dac2c5ec8d83171a00000a"), "title" : "mongo demo", "content" : "uses the mongo_mapper gem", "created_at" : "Mon Jul 08 2013 05:46:45 GMT-0800 (AHST)", "updated_at" : "Mon Jul 08 2013 05:46:45 GMT-0800 (AHST)" }
